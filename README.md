# Customer churn analysis

# Overview :
The dataset is about customer churn of telecom comapany. It contains 7043 records about customer details as gender, services subscribed, payment methods etc.
To better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager covers these points : 
  1. Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
  2. The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
  3. Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
  4. We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
  5. We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
